# ML-Algorithm-test-case

This project is aiming to compare some Machine Learning Algorithm based on e-commerce databases (costomer_data.csv and transaction_data.csv) to predict the fraudulent transaction.
We start to explore the data and see the behaviour of customers that has potential factor to be fraud. We also try to fit the model into the data and see which model has more accuracy to predict future fraud cases based on given historical databases.
